# 🎲 Responsible Gaming: AI-Powered Risk Monitoring  

## 📌 Overview  

Responsible gaming is essential for ensuring a safe and ethical gaming environment for players. This project focuses on using data-driven techniques to detect risky behaviors, prevent problem gambling, and promote healthy gaming habits. By leveraging machine learning and real-time analytics, we can identify potential harm early and provide timely interventions.  

## ❗ Problem Statement  

The gaming industry faces significant challenges related to problem gambling, including financial distress, mental health issues, and regulatory compliance. Traditional methods of identifying at-risk players rely on self-reported data, which is often inaccurate or delayed. The goal of this project is to develop an automated, data-driven approach to detect and mitigate gaming-related harm.  

## 🚀 Key Features  

- **Behavioral Analytics**: Monitor player activity to detect unusual patterns, such as excessive spending or extended gaming sessions.  
- **Risk Scoring Model**: Use machine learning to assign risk scores to players based on their gaming behavior.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Trigger alerts for operators or responsible gaming teams when high-risk behaviors are detected.  
- **Personalized Interventions**: Suggest customized messages, self-exclusion options, or spending limits to help players manage their habits.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to responsible gaming regulations by providing transparency and reporting mechanisms.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines for handling gaming data efficiently.  
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised / Unsupervised learning models for risk detection.  
- **Dashboard & Reporting**: Visualization tools to monitor player risk trends and alerts.  

## 📂 Dataset  

**Dataset Path**: `s3a://db-gtm-industry-solutions/data/CME/real_money_gaming/data/raw/*`

This dataset includes anonymized transactional records related to gaming activities, which can be used for risk analysis, behavioral modeling, and responsible gaming research.
